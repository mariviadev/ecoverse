## Introduction
Ecoverse is a marketing landing page for a fictional VR educational technology platform that I conceptualized with a little help from ChatGPT. Developed as a personal project, this project demonstrates the application of newly gained modern web skills and 3D animations. The project was guided by a tutorial, however I revamped the content and design to showcase my personal ability to create engaging and dynamic web experiences.
